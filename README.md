![Statistics](https://img.shields.io/badge/Statistics-Educational-brightgreen)

Welcome to the "Introduction to Descriptive and Inferential Statistics" project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that serves as a quick guide for beginners to understand and apply fundamental concepts of statistics.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to provide learners with a solid foundation in both descriptive and inferential statistics. Whether you're a student, professional, or simply curious about statistics, this project will guide you through the essential principles in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.

## Features

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Learn how to summarize, visualize, and interpret data using measures of central tendency, dispersion, and frequency distributions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore relationships, distributions, and patterns within the data to gain insights before diving into inferential analyses.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Understand the process of hypothesis formulation, choose appropriate tests, and analyze sample data to make informed conclusions.
- **Regression and Correlation:** Discover how to model relationships between variables, make predictions, and assess correlations.
- **Practical Applications:** Apply statistical concepts to real-world scenarios using a comprehensive dataset.
- **Resources and Further Learning:** Access additional references and resources to continue your statistical journey.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ibromodzi/statistics-learning-guide.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd statistics-learning-guide`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`

## Dataset

The project uses the Treatment Episode Data Set - Admissions (TEDS-A) as its primary dataset. TEDS-A captures admissions data for substance use treatment facilities in the United States and its jurisdictions. You'll explore various aspects of this dataset to learn statistical concepts. You can access the TEDS-A dataset used in this project from the following link:

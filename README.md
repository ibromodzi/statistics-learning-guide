![Statistics](https://img.shields.io/badge/Statistics-Educational-brightgreen)

Welcome to the "Comprehensive Introduction to Descriptive and Inferential Statistics" project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that serves as a comprehensive guide for beginners to understand and apply fundamental concepts of statistics.

## Project Overview

This project is designed to provide learners with a solid foundation in both descriptive and inferential statistics. Whether you're a student, professional, or simply curious about statistics, this project will guide you through the essential principles in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.

## Features

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Learn how to summarize, visualize, and interpret data using measures of central tendency, dispersion, and frequency distributions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore relationships, distributions, and patterns within the data to gain insights before diving into inferential analyses.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Understand the process of hypothesis formulation, choose appropriate tests, and analyze sample data to make informed conclusions.
- **Regression and Correlation:** Discover how to model relationships between variables, make predictions, and assess correlations.
- **Practical Applications:** Apply statistical concepts to real-world scenarios using a comprehensive dataset.
- **Resources and Further Learning:** Access additional references and resources to continue your statistical journey.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ibromodzi/statistics-learning-guide.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd statistics-learning-guide`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`

## Dataset

The project uses the Treatment Episode Data Set - Admissions (TEDS-A) as its primary dataset. TEDS-A captures admissions data for substance use treatment facilities in the United States and its jurisdictions. You'll explore various aspects of this dataset to learn statistical concepts.

## Notebook Structure

The Jupyter Notebook is organized into sections, each covering a specific statistical topic. Concepts are explained with clear examples, visualizations, and practical exercises to enhance your understanding.
